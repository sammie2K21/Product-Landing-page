            <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented, and secure programming language.</p>
            <p>Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle) in 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.</p>
            <p>Java example:</p>
            <code>
                class Simple {  
                    public static void main(String args[]) {  
                        System.out.println("Hello Java");  
                    }  
                }  
            </code>
            <p>Example 2:</p>
            <code>
                public class HelloWorld {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        // Print "Hello, World!" to the console
                        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
                    }
                }
            </code>

            <header>History</header> 
            <p>Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as the Green Team) initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.</p>
            <p>The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.</p>
            <p>Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. Following are significant points that describe the history of Java.</p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of Sun engineers called the Green Team.</li>
                <li>Initially, it was designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.</li>
                <li>Initially, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.</li>
                <li>In 1995, Oak was renamed to "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.</li>
                <li>Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Features">
            <header>Features</header> 
            <p>A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below.</p>
           
            <ol>
                <li>Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean, and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystems, Java language is a simple programming language because:</li>
                <li>Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object.</li>
                <li><span>Java</span> is platform-independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc., which are compiled into platform-specific machines, while Java is a write-once, run-anywhere language.</li>
                <li>Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any implementation.</li>
                <li>Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        
   
        <section class="main-section" id="Program">
            <header>Program</header> 
            <p>To create a simple Java program, you need to create a class that contains the main method. Let's understand the requirement first.</p>
            <p>The requirement for Java Hello World Example:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Install the JDK if you haven't already. Download the JDK and install it.</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-set-path-in-java">Set the path of the jdk/bin directory</a></li>
                <li>Create the Java program</li>
                <li>Compile and run the Java program</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Creating a Hello World program:</p>
            <code>
                class Simple {  
                    public static void main(String args[]) {  
                        System.out.println("Hello Java");  
                    }  
                }  
            </code>
            <p>Here is a Java program to print "Hello, World!":</p>
            <code>
                public class HelloWorld {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
                    }
                }
            </code>
            <p>Example 3:</p>
            <code>
                // This program calculates the sum of two numbers

                public class SumCalculator {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        // Declare and initialize two integer variables
                        int number1 = 10;
                        int number2 = 20;

                        // Calculate the sum of the two numbers
                        int sum = number1 + number2;

                        // Print the sum to the console
                        System.out.println("The sum of " + number1 + " and " + number2 + " is " + sum);
                    }
                }
            </code>

            <header>Variables</header> 
            <p>A variable is a container that holds a value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type.</p>
            <p>A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of the memory location. It is a combination of "vary + able," which means its value can be changed.</p>
